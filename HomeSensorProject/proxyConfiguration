Description:
Simple reverse proxy configuartion that can be added

Steps:
add these lines into /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
run systemctl start nginx
access web server through the reverse proxy address
reverse proxy address is 127.0.0.1 listening on port 80

NOTE:
This reverse proxy is not secure
Example: it's running over http

Future Work:
Provide an https reverse proxy server
Provide reverse proxy cache system

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name 127.0.0.1;
  location / {
    proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:5000;
  }
}
